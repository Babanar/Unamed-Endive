Are you going to make any money off of this game? If so, I'd like to discuss a cut; otherwise, go right ahead if you give the proper credits :)

loodoor said the following:  
No, I won't make any money from it ^^  
Also, the code is open to everybody if you are interested in (just there : github.com/Loodoor/Unamed)  
Thank you so much :D !!
