Objects specification
=====================
An object is defined as follows :

* a unique id (integer)
* a name (string)
* a description (optionnal) (string)
* a price (integer)
* does one use equal one object ? (boolean)
* can we drop it ? (boolean)
* a value (integer)
* a type (integer, translated into an enumeration element)

Each of these will be defined below.

## Unique id
This id is useful to identify easily an object, because they are all stored in the bag as follows :
pocket : [{id: id0, quantity: qu0}, ... {id: idN, quantity: quN}]

## Name
Only interesting to display its information in the bag view.

## Description
Same as before.

## Price
The price is an integer between 0 and 999. A value of 0 does not mean it is free, but that we can not sell it.

## Limited use
If set to false, it is like a bicycle, you can use it how many times you want. Otherwise, one use = one object.

## Throwaway
If set to false, you can not drop the object (example of a rare object). Otherwise you can separate yourself from it.

## Type
We are explaining this field before the value, because it is strongly linked to it.

There is 8 different types of object :

* player (0)
* healpv (1)
* healpp (2)
* healstatus (3)
* capture (4)
* levelup (5)
* lowercooldown (6)
* none (7)

An object of type player is an equipment, as a bicycle.

An object of type healpv if healing the life of a single creature.

An object of type heal pp is healing the power points (no joke) of a creature.

An object of type heal status is taking off a single status of a single creature.

An object of type capture is like a "ball" in the traditional PokÃ©mon games (copyright Nintendo and Game Freak).

An object of type levelup can increase the level of a single creature.

An object of type lowercooldown can lower the cooldown time of a creature.

An object of type none should never be used, it is an internal type of object used when this data can not be found.

## Value
Linked to the type of the object.

The value is an integer between -999 and 999.

```
